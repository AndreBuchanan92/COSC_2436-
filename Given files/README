The files here demonstrate a complete program that has all of the following:
 - a complete main using argc and argv
 - proper header and cpp file structure
 - the inclusion of a procedural programming module (functions)
 - the inclusion of a class and objects made from that class (Rectangle)
 - loose coupling (i.e. the functions module and the Rectangle class
   can be moved to other programs as-is and they will work separated
   from main and from each other.
